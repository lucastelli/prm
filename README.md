# Probabilistic RoadMap

This is a project of Advanced Computer Architecture, a course of master degree in Computer Engineering of University of Pavia.

Goals

The goals of this project are:
1) develop a program that simulate a Probabilistic RoadMap robot planner both for robot manipulator and mobile robot.
2) develop GJK distance algorithm for collision detection.
3) develop A* algorithm to find the optimal path.
4) use OpenCV library to display the results.
5) parallelized these programs using OpenMP library to speed-up their execution.

These programs are written in C/C++.
